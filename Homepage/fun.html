<h3>Fun Hobbies</h3>
<p> Working all the time would completely burn someone out quickly, so I also have hobbies that are for relaxing and giving my mind a break. In college,
I picked up weight lifting with my best friends Chris and Vince. While it may be boring at first, weightlifting becomes a great way to destress and work
on your health and mental state because you not only keep your body exercising, but you slowly see progress that you thought was impossible to achieve. Also,
the culture at the gym is almost always very supportive, since even the strongest and most athletic people started from somewhere. They are always willing to give
you tips or lend a hand when needed. </p>

<h3>Soccer</h3>
<p> Since I was three years old, I've always spent most of my time playing competetive soccer. Being Brazilian, this is not very surprising to most people.
   Playing soccer not only gave me some of my best friends from back home in Miami, but it allowed me to travel and explore a lot of places I would have never seen
   otherwise. Some states I've visited thanks to soccer include Georgia, South Carolina, Arizona and Delaware. In college, I got to see a majority of upstate New York
   while play soccer with Cornell's Club Soccer team.
