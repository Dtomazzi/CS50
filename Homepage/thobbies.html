<h3>Reading</h3>
<hr>
<p> In the few hours when I am not at work or relaxing with my friends, I enjoy some hobbies where I can learn about some personal interests of mine.
In college, I studied philosophy quite heavily, and I continue this passion until today! My favorite areas of philosophy include human understanding and
analyzing how people learn and adapt to society. A few books on my bookshelf today include: A Essay on Human Understanding by John Locke, Interpretations
of Dreams by Sigmund Freud, and Philosophy for the Modern Man. These books take deep dives into subjects we typically don't think too much about, such as why
we dream, and what these dreams mean. While many people believe philosophy is all about opinions, this is far from the truth. A lot of research and thoughtful
study goes into philosophical essays and curriculums.</p>

<h3> Cars and Motorcycles</h3>
<hr>
<p> Since I was young, I've always tinkered around with the tools and gadgets in my dad's garage. I started with smaller work, like replacing the battery on my
Iphone 4. This was a great way to save money, since the cost of the new battery and tools were only abou $50, whereas a brand new phone was around $600  (at the time).
From there, I found a large tv on the side of the road which I picked up and fixed, and I helped work on my dad's lawn tools which had a hard time running from sitting
so long. When I got older, this passion naturally turned to cars and motorcycles. I would always talk about different cars and car modifications with my friends, and
often times I would browse craigslist in search of what would potentially be my first car. Recently, I got my motorcycle license (something I've always wanted to do!)
and I even purchased my very own bike! This was a satisfying feeling, because I got out of my comfort zone and made my first steps toward "adulting".  </p>
