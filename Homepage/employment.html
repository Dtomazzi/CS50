<h3>GiveGab: Early Beginnings</h3>
<hr>
<p>GiveGab, originally founded in 2011, was created as a volunteering platform to help people
   find volunteering opportunities around their local communities. After three years of nonprofit work,
   the final key to helping nonprofits was discovered: fundraising. After hearing feedback from various
   friends and nonprofit professionals, GiveGab (previously iYOUVO), adapted and grew into what would
   become a large, giving and engagement platform for nonprofits. GiveGab provides the tools for online
   fundraising, supporter engagement, donor management, and more! </p>

 <h3>GiveGab: The Acquisition!</h3>
 <hr>
 <p> In 2018, it was announced that GiveGab would be acquiring one of our
 long time competitors, Kimbia. Kimbia was a fundraising platform that also hosted Giving Days,
 but after a technology glitch in 2016 that affected Give Local America on their big day, they
 received criticism and negative spotlight. Our CEO, Charlie Mulligan, saw this as a great opportunity
 to acquire the company, and have our current technology adapt with that of of Kimbias in an effort
 to further expand our mission of helping nonprofits. Almost all of the giving days previously running
 on Kimbia decided to migrate over to the GiveGab platform, many of which have already successfully ran
 this past Fall under new management! </p>

 <h3> GiveGab in 2019</h3>
 <hr>
 <p> As of March, GiveGab now has almost 60 employees, and growing! As the spring begins, we have
 kicked off some great giving days, including Amplify Austin Day, Fairfield County Gives, and Sarah
 Lawrence College giving day. Amplify Austin exceeded its stretch goal of raising more than $11 million
 dollars on the platform, with both online and offline donations. Before the summer comes around, there
 will be close to 40 more giving days, and we are hoping they all will crush their goals and support
 all of the various nonprofits across the United States. Nonprofits are behind some of the greatest
 accomplishments and organizations, and we hope to continue providing the tools and resources to expand
 the outreach of all these amazing nonprofits!</p>
